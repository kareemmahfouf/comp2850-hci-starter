# Job Stories — Week 6 Needs-Finding

## Story S1: Filter Persistence

**Situation**: When I return to my task list after a break
**Motivation**: I want my previously applied filters and sorting to remain active
**Outcome**: So I can quickly regain context without mentally reconstructing my workspace
**Underlying need**: Because recalculating the relevant tasks every session increases cognitive load and slows down weekly planning

**Evidence**: Participant A (filter persistence, cognitive load) 
**Inclusion risk**: Cognitive load, ADHD spectrum, low digital literacy
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: 3.2.4 Consistent Identification (AA)



## Story S2: Confirmation Feedback

**Situation**: When I submit a form (add/edit/delete task) or mark a task complete
**Motivation**: I want immediate and explicit confirmation—or an easy undo
**Outcome**: So I can trust that I haven’t accidentally removed something important
**Underlying need**: Because accidental completion/deletion leads to real-world consequences like missed deadlines and anxiety

**Evidence**: Participant A (accidental completion → missed submission) 
**Inclusion risk**: Cognitive, screen reader, motor slip risk
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: 4.1.3 Status Messages (AA)



## Story S3: Keyboard Accessibility

**Situation**: When my mouse or trackpad isn’t available
**Motivation**: I want to navigate the entire interface using only the keyboard
**Outcome**: So I can stay productive in any environment
**Underlying need**: Because relying on memorised keybinds or inconsistent focus states creates unnecessary barriers and slows down work

**Evidence**: Participant A (frequent keyboard use, struggles remembering keybinds, importance of focus states) 
**Inclusion risk**: Temporary impairment, motor impairments, power users
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: 2.1.1 Keyboard (A)



## Story S4: High Contrast & Zoom Compatibility

**Situation**: When I'm using the interface in bright sunlight or low-light environments
**Motivation**: I want high-contrast text and layouts that remain functional at 200% zoom
**Outcome**: So I can read and interact comfortably without losing functionality
**Underlying need**: Because low vision and light sensitivity are exacerbated by poor contrast or broken layouts at high zoom

**Evidence**: Participant A (severe nearsightedness, light sensitivity, zoom issues) 
**Inclusion risk**: Low-vision users, situational impairments (sunlight), zoom users
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: 1.4.10 Reflow (AA), 1.4.3 Contrast (AA)



## Story S5: Deadline Visibility

**Situation**: When I scan my task list for the day or week
**Motivation**: I want to see each task’s due date and time inline
**Outcome**: So I can prioritise efficiently without opening extra detail screens
**Underlying need**: Because hidden metadata makes planning harder and increases deadline anxiety

**Evidence**: Participant A (wants “widget formatting” showing date/time) 
**Inclusion risk**: Cognitive load, time-sensitive tasks
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: N/A (design enhancement)



## Story S6: Error Prevention for Critical Tasks

**Situation**: When I'm managing tasks with serious consequences (eg. deadlines)
**Motivation**: I want safeguards that prevent accidental task deletion or completion
**Outcome**: So I don’t inadvertently lose important reminders
**Underlying need**: Because accidental activation currently leads to forgotten tasks and last-minute stress

**Evidence**: Participant A (accidental removal → forgotten assignment) 
**Inclusion risk**: Motor slips, cognitive, low-vision (mis-tapping), screen reader users
**Type**: Job story
**WCAG**: 3.3.4 Error Prevention (Legal/Financial/Data) (AA)
